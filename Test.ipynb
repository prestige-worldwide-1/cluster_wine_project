    "The goal of this project is to identify drivers of wine quality for the California Wine Institute, utilizing data-driven analysis and machine learning techniques. The primary focus will be on exploring how the utilization of clusters (groupings) of wine samples can improve the performance of the machine learning model, specifically in the context of winery supply chain marketing. This analysis is on data from the Cortez et al 2009 dataset.\n",

    "1. Discover drivers of wine quality.\n",
    "2. Find useful clusters that help machine learning (ML) models predict wine quality.\n",
    "3. Use main drivers and clusters to develop a machine learning model to predict wine quality.\n",

    "## <a name=\"hypotheses\"></a>Hypotheses\n",
    "[[Back to top](#top)]\n",
    "1. **Chemical Composition Impact**: We hypothesize that specific chemical components in wine, such as acidity, residual sugar, and alcohol content, significantly influence wine quality. We expect to observe certain threshold values beyond which these components may positively or negatively affect the wine's overall rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cluster Analysis Effect**: We hypothesize that creating clusters of similar wine samples based on their chemical attributes will help identify distinct groups of wines with similar characteristics which predict their quality rating. By incorporating these clusters as additional features in our machine learning model, we anticipate an improvement in predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interaction Effects**: We will investigate potential interactions between different features to determine if their combined influence has a more significant impact on wine quality than individual effects alone.\n",

    "1. **Data Preprocessing**: We will begin by exploring the dataset to handle any missing values, outliers, or data integrity issues. Feature engineering will be performed to create additional relevant features, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this phase, we will visualize the distribution of each feature and its relationship with wine quality. We will identify any notable trends or patterns that support or refute our initial hypotheses using appropriate statistical testing such as pearson's r.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cluster Analysis**: Using unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means clustering, we will group similar wine samples together based on their physiochemical attributes. This will help us gain insights into the different segments of wines present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Machine Learning Models**: We will build predictive models using various algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Additionally, we will incorporate the identified clusters as additional features and compare the model performance with and without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Model performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE), and accuracy. The use of clusters will be assessed based on the improvement in model accuracy and interpretability.\n",
